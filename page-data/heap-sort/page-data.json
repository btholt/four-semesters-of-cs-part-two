The first one we're going to deal with heap sort, a very clever algorithm based on trees.</p>\n<p>Let's first address what a heap is. A heap is an array that represents a tree data structure and has to be sorted in a particular way to represent that tree. Priority queues are often represented as heaps and often those two terms are used interchangeably even if the the priority queue is implemented a different way.</p>\n<p>We're going to be talking about binary heaps today but know there are others. A binary heap translates to a binary tree, similar to the binary search trees that part one covers. Let's list out what makes a BST (binary search tree) and a binary heap different</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A binary heap is an array; a BST is made up of node objects (typically.)</li>\n<li>In a BST, there is a strict order where a left child is always smaller than the parent and the right node is always greater. This is not true of a binary heap. The only guarantee of binary heap is the parent is greater than the children, there are no guarantees between sibling nodes.</li>\n<li>Similar to the above point, if you do an in-order traversal of a BST, you'll get a sorted list. This does not work in a binary heap.</li>\n<li>A binary heap is a \"complete binary tree.\" This means it's as compact as possible. All the children of each node are as full as they can be and left children are filled out first. This is not true of a BST: they can be sparse.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Binary heaps come in two falvors: max heaps and min heaps. We'll be dealing with max heaps (which help you find the greatest number in the heap) but you can imagine that if you flip all the comparisons you'd have a min heap (which helps you find the smallest number.)</p>\n<p>So this is why a priority queue is often a binary heap: it's very easy to tell the largest number in a binary heap. None of the other is guaranteed, but once you dequeue (or take the next element off) it's easy to find the next item in the queue. In fact, that's how heapsort works: you construct an internal priority queue and then remove an item at a time and stick it at the end and then find the next largest item in the priority queue; rinse and repeat.</p>\n<p>The way to represent a binary tree as an array is that for any index of an array <em>n</em>, its left child is stored at 2n + 1; and its right child is at 2n + 2. The root node will always be at 0. That means the root node's left child is at 1 and right child is at 2. 1's left child is at 3 and right is at 4.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 800px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 25.5%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Binary Heap Visual Diagram\"\n        title=\"Binary Heap Visual Diagram\"\n        src=\"/static/e69faa56933b6912c64abdbf72c37cf2/4b190/heap.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/e69faa56933b6912c64abdbf72c37cf2/e07e9/heap.jpg 200w,\n/static/e69faa56933b6912c64abdbf72c37cf2/066f9/heap.jpg 400w,\n/static/e69faa56933b6912c64abdbf72c37cf2/4b190/heap.jpg 800w,\n/static/e69faa56933b6912c64abdbf72c37cf2/4d836/heap.jpg 920w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span>\nCourtesy of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)\">Wikimedia</a></p>\n<p>Once you construct a heap, removing an item from it is done in constant time since you need to find the next largest node to move to the root. This process is typically called <em>heapify</em>. In order to construct a max heap, you run heapify starting at the middle of the array and work backwards to the root. You don't need to do it from the end because heapify will inherently look at those nodes.</p>\n<p>So the process of heapsort is</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make the array a max heap</li>\n<li>Loop over the array, dequeuing the root node (which will give you the largest item) and swapping that with last item in the array</li>\n<li>After dequeuing each item, run heapify again (same function we used to create the heap) once to find the next root node</li>\n<li>Next loop you'll dequeue the root node and swap it with the second-to-last item in the array and run heapify again.</li>\n<li>Once you've run out of items to dequeue, you have a sorted array! Let's see what that looks like.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">// initial array\n[5, 3, 2, 10, 1, 9, 8, 6, 4, 7]\n\n// heapify the array\nstart at index 5, value 9\nits left child is at index 11 and right 12, out of bounds\nnothing to do, next iteration\n\ni-- index 4, value 1\nleft child is index 9 value 7, right child is index 10, out of bounds\n7 is larger than 1, swap left child and parent\n[5, 3, 2, 10, 7, 9, 8, 6, 4, 1]\ncall heapify on index 9, does nothing\n\ni-- index 3, value 10\nleft child is index 7 value 6, right child is index 8 value 4\nneither is larger than 10\nnothing to do, next iteration\n\ni-- index 2, value 2\nleft child is index 5 value 9, right child is index 6 value 8\n9 is the largest number, swap with parent\n[5, 3, 9, 10, 7, 2, 8, 6, 4, 1]\ncall heapify on index 5, does nothing\n\ni-- index 1, value 3\nleft child is index 3 value 10, right child is index 4 value 7\n10 is in the largest number, swap with parent\n[5, 10, 9, 3, 7, 2, 8, 6, 4, 1]\ncall heapify on index 3\nleft child is index 7 value 6, right child is index 8 value 4\n6 is larger, swap with parent\n[5, 10, 9, 6, 7, 2, 8, 3, 4, 1]\ncall heapify on index 7, does nothing\n\ni-- index 0, value 5\nleft child is index 1 value 10, right child is index 2 value 9\n10 is in the largest number, swap with parent\n[10, 5, 9, 6, 7, 2, 8, 3, 4, 1]\ncall heapify on index 1\nleft child is index 3 value 6, right child is index 4 value 7\n7 is larger, swap with parent\n[10, 7, 9, 6, 5, 2, 8, 3, 4, 1]\ncall heapify on index 4\nleft child is index 9 value 1, right child is index 10, out of bounds\nparent is larger, does nothing</code></pre></div>\n<p>Now our array is officially a heap.
